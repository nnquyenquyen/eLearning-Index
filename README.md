# eLearning Index Project
This project aims to provide a dynamic and interactive representation of the annual eLearning Index based on extensive secondary data analysis from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the National Association of Colleges and Employers. By transforming a static, paper-based index into an engaging Tableau workbook, this project enhances accessibility and usability, making it easier for stakeholders to explore and derive insights from the data.
