# eLearning Index Project
This project aims to provide a dynamic and interactive representation of the annual eLearning Index based on extensive secondary data analysis from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and the National Association of Colleges and Employers. By transforming a static, paper-based index into an engaging Tableau workbook, this project enhances accessibility and usability, making it easier for stakeholders to explore and derive insights from the data.

## Project Objective

The primary objective of the eLearning Index Project is to offer a user-friendly and data-rich resource for anyone interested in understanding student demand and labor demand in the next ten years (2021-2031) for college programs, the demographic distribution of student as well as progressive degrees. 

1. **Data Analysis**: Leverage secondary data from the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics and encompassing information on 7000+ U.S. institutions, to provide comprehensive and up-to-date insights into eLearning trends.

2. **Interactive visualization**: Create an intuitive Tableau workbook that allows users to interact with the eLearning Index data, facilitating exploration and deeper insights.
